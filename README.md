# Intermediate Excel Statistics for Business Analytics

Resources for O'Reilly Online Learning course, "Intermediate Excel Statistics for Business Analytics" 
 
Inferential statistics involves inferring parameters of a population based on the values of a sample. These tests can include comparing multiple populations for differences,comparing the same individual at different points in time, or predicting the value of one variable given another. 

Join expert George Mount for a hands-on approach to conducting intermediate statistical inference using Microsoft Excel. By the end of this course, users will be able to organize, present, and draw valid conclusions from data, using inferential statistics for business impact.


What you'll learn — and how you can apply it
By the end of this live, hands-on, online course, you’ll understand:
The trade-off between Type I and Type II errors
The relationship between correlation and causation
How statistics and visualizations each play a part in effective quantitative analysis

And you’ll be able to:

Make graphical representations of one or more variables
Test for differences across multiple groups and at multiple points in time
Model a causal relationship between two variables
Make compelling business recommendations using inferential statistics

This training is for you because...
You want to apply more rigorous methods to your business decision making.
You’re an Excel user interested in learning more about data science.
You’re a researcher or analyst looking to apply statistical methods to business.
You can conduct basic statistical analysis in Excel and want to take your skills to the next level.
